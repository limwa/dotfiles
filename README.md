# dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, configurations, and other files that I use on my Linux systems.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `backgrounds`: This directory contains background images that I use in my Desktop Environment.
- `hosts`: This directory contains the configurations for different hosts. For now, this only contains the configuration for my personal laptop.
- `modules`: This directory contains NixOS modules that I can share across different host configurations.

## Thanks

I would like to thank [pbek](https://github.com/pbek) for his [pbek/nixcfg](https://github.com/pbek/nixcfg) repository, which served as a great inspiration for this repository.
